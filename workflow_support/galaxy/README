This folder contains support files for workflow engines.

It is possible to integrate BALL (namely, its tools) into workflow engines, such as Galaxy.

The files contained here are needed by CTD2Galaxy, which takes CTDs and generates Galaxy ToolConfig stubs (see https://github.com/WorkflowConversion/CTD2Galaxy).

BALL itself is not responsible for integrating itself into the many workflow systems, however, providing support files makes the task easier for workflow enthusiasts.
